				<h1>About me</h1>
				<p>Hey there. My name is Tor Morten. I’m is a passionate full-stack developer with a passion for effective and agile workflows and great user experiences.</p>
				<p>I hail from the middle part of Norway, and I’m 28 years old. I’m also engaged, and together with my soon-to-be wife I have a son.</p>
                <p>My journey in to web development started with my dad’s interest in creating web sites in the late 90’s. I immediately started
                creating websites for my favourite football teams in Front Page. After a while I got interesting in the code behind the websites,
                which led me to acquire a copy of “PHP for dummies” in 2004. Ever since I’ve been focused on improving as a PHP developer.</p>
                <p>On my spare-time I spend a lot of time making my home smart, and creating cool sensors using NodeMCU's and Arduino's.</p>
